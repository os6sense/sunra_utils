# Full command line to capture from the video/audio capture card.
# if capturing directly via ffmpeg then include all ffmpeg options
# and the target URL of the ffserver at the end

# For blackmagic cards use bmdcapture with ffmpeg_pipe e.g.

#ffmpeg_pipe: "ffmpeg -v 0 -i - http://localhost:8090/feed1.ffm"

# For testing/re-encoding ffmpeg can be used. The following line puts ffmpeg into quiet mode (-v 0), limits the frame rate (-re) 
# and uses one of the blender OS films to feed into ffserver.
capture_command: "ffmpeg -v 0 -re -i /home/leej/sunra-3rdParty/OSFilms/tears_of_steel_720p.mkv  http://localhost:8090/feed1.ffm"

#Sintel.2010.720p.mkv
#tears_of_steel_1080p.mkv
#tears_of_steel_720p.mkv

# If you need to use something other than ffmpeg to capture enter
# the full capture_command above use ffmpeg as a piped target.
# Otherwise leave ffmpeg_pipe blank
